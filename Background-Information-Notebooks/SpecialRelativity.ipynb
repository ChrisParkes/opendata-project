    "Special relativity describes the relationship between time and space. It has a range of consequences, including length contraction, time dilation and the universal speed limit of the speed of light. Furthermore, it accounts for the mass-energy equivalence and for relativistic mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">The mass-energy equivalence is expressed by the formula E=mc<sup>2</sup>, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Intrinsic mass is a characteristic of the total energy and momentum of a certain object. It can also describe the total energy and momentum of a system of objetcs, in our case, a system of different particles. If there is a center of momentum for the system, the invariant mass is the total energy divided by the speed of light squared.</div> \n",
    "\n",
    "The full formula for the invariant mass is:\n",
    "\n",
    "M<sup>2</sup><sub>inv</sub>= E<sup>2</sup> - <u>p</u><sup>2</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "where M<sup>2</sup><sub>inv</sub> is the invariant mass squared, E<sup>2</sup> is the energy squared and <u>p</u><sup>2</sup> is the momentum squared. It is important to notice that the momentum is a vector, while the energy is a scalar. The squares have to be calculated accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a system of objects is considered, the calculation looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "M<sup>2</sup><sub>inv</sub>= (E<sub>obj1</sub> + E<sub>obj2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> - (<u>p</u><sub>obj1</sub> + <u>p</u><sub>obj2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the value for the invariant mass, you simply need to take the square root of M<sup>2</sup><sub>inv</sub>. The units of invariant mass are MeV/c<sup>2</sup>."
